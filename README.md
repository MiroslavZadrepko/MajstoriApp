## READ FIRST
After Heroku stoped free services I decided to switch to mongoDB. So, this is under construction, so to say, and it is not fully functional. 

## Project title
Craftsman's application.
 
## Features
It's a database of craftsmen. You can search for specific craftsmen by profession and after search, if you are logged in, you can see or give reviews for specific craftsman. 

## Tech/framework used
MERN, Styled Components, MUI, React Router, Git, VS Code

## ToDo
Convert to MERN + redux fully, 
add review,
rev and add craftsman from tmp to perma base,

translation to english, 
responsivnes. 

## Work in progress :)
